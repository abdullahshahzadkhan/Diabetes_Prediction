# Diabetes_Prediction using Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
This project implements a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on health data. The process includes:

* Data Loading and Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset.
* Feature Scaling: Applied feature scaling to normalize the input data.
* Modeling: Implemented and compared two machine learning models:
* Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Achieved better performance.
* Logistic Regression: Used as a baseline model.
* Evaluation: Calculated and compared accuracy scores on both training and test datasets to evaluate model performance.
